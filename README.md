# About this repository
Unofficial course repository intended for practice in Web Development. It contains some information about the Introduction to Zoology course (University of Buenos Aires, Faculty of Exact and Natural Sciences)

Disclaimers and features
1) I'm not affiliated with the Department of Biodiversity and Experimental Biology.
2) Contact information of Professors were provided during the course and are meant to be used only by students for inquiries. Until I get authorization, the links in "Docentes" will redirect to a dummy e-mail for testing purposes.
3) Since the format of the end-of-terms surveys has changed during The Plague, I have provided a page with links that redirect to the Faculty Web Pages.
4) Most of the project is still in development, but the basic structure and format is there.
5) I've tried to make the color palette accessible. If you recognize an issue, please let me know!

Are you also a student at Ciudad Universitaria and want to help? Contact me!
